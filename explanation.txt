I have re-read the file `c:\Users\chereto\Desktop\eoty-platform\frontend\src\components\dashboard\StudentDashboard\ProgressTracker.tsx`. The file I have access to contains 140 lines of code.

The error message you provided states the issue is "online 325". This indicates a significant discrepancy between the file I am viewing and the file where the error is occurring for you. It's possible that:

1.  You are looking at a different version of the file.
2.  There is a build process that generates a larger file, and the error is in the generated output.
3.  The line number provided is incorrect for the file I have.

To help me resolve this, please provide the content of the `ProgressTracker.tsx` file from your environment, specifically focusing on the code around line 325. If possible, providing the full content of the file you are seeing would be most helpful.

Without the correct content of the file at line 325, I cannot identify or fix the comparison issue between '"neutral"' and '"negative"'.
